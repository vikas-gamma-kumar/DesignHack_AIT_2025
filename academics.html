                <h1>Message
                </h1>
                <br>
                <p>AIT was established in 1994 and within a short span of 30 years since inception as compared to some
                    old institutes like COEP, it has established itself as a prestigious engineering institution under
                    Savitribai Phule Pune University (formerly University of Pune). Our students have consistently shown
                    very good performance and have obtained excellent placements. All departments of AIT obtained
                    reaccreditation from the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) for three years. This has been
                    possible due to the excellent co-ordination and support of the staff, management, administration,
                    students and their parents. AIT is also getting top ranking in NIRF, Outlook, Data Quest, THE WEEK
                    and similar agencies.</p>

                <br>
                <p>The excellent facilities of our college are in a continuous process of up gradation. Our students are
                    curious and avail the latest equipment, software etc. much beyond requirements of the syllabus. They
                    are also provided with avenues and the state of the art facilities to develop an overall
                    personality. Many students have fetched laurels in Sports, Paper Presentations, Hackathons, Essay,
                    Debate Competitions at National/International Levels; as well developed social useful software.
                    Recently we started developing culture of startup in AIT it will result in the small step towards
                    Atmanirbahar Bharat.
                </p>



                <br>
                <p>I am sure our students will continue their stellar performance during the course and their career
                    ahead. I am also certain that they will put in their best efforts towards post graduate and research
                    studies and carve an envious career. I am also confident about their potential in accepting global
                    challenges and reinforcing the AIT brand name, shortly in the World map. </p>

                    failure. Persist! The world needs all you can give."- E. O. Wilson </p>

                <p>AIT students have enjoyed excellent placements over the years. The 2022-23 batch has achieved 96%
                    placements with an average salary of Rs. 14.2 lakh. A good number of AIT students of second and
                    third year have enrolled for internships with reputed companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon,
                    Deutsche Bank, Dream Plug and some Indian start-ups. Many of them are drawing monthly stipend of
                    over Rs. One lakh. Internships with such reputed organisations provide a great launch pad for
                    amazing careers. One such student Mr Abhishek Kumar of TE(IT) has been selected for an internship
                    with Amazon London, at a monthly stipend of equivalent to Rs. Four lakh approx, another Shristy
                    Thakur SE (E&TC) student has proceeded for an internship in Jun 23 at Barclays Bank in UK for
                    monthly stipend of equivalent to Rs. 3 lakhs. </p>



                <br>
                <p>With the approval of the AIT Growth plan by HQ AWES, the intake of AIT is set to double in next 3-4
                    years. We are already increasing the intake in IT stream by 60 in AY 2023-24. We will be introducing
                    a UG course in BE (Robotics and Automation). AIT is also looking at introducing new PG programs,
                    establishing Centres of Excellence and Research Centres. The ME course in Data Science has already
                    been launched this year. Apart from regular degree courses, AIT is also starting short term
                    diploma/certification courses in collaboration with reputed training institutes in niche technology
                    fields such as Embedded Systems, VLSI, Data Science etc, to meet the fast growing demands of
                    industry. </p>



                <br>
                <p>All these student achievements cannot be accomplished without commitment, guidance and support of the
                    committed faculty of AIT. The faculty too is going all out to enhance their knowledge, reputation
                    and improve the research footprint of the college. </p>



                <br>
                <p>AIT prides itself in having an excellent academic extracurricular and sports infrastructure. This
                    ensures all round development of students and total quality engineers passing out from AIT. </p> -->
